##  The Story

A few years ago, you and your friends once enjoyed sharing a channel in Avachat, the avatar based chat program.
However, over time more and more of your friends left the channel and eventually, you did too.

Today, when you checked your inbox you found an email describing the new features added to Avachat!
Excited to try them out, you return only to find an empty channel.

So you find yourself a new channel, with new people to befriend.   

##  The Goal

The main goal is to befriend one of the four girls: Dolly, Pitys, Judy, or Anna. 
Each girl has a friendship meter on the page. Your actions in the game can increase 
your friendship. As you become friends the girls may ask you questions. The better your answer, the
closer your friendship will become. 

Friendship can increase by building items and by posting "interesting" things.
* Items are bought with points, which are gained every time you post.
* The girls like it when items are built near their avatar.
* Each girl has a few words that she finds interesting, and posts with those words will increase her friendship.
* If you are having trouble coming up with interesting words, try words related to the theme.

##  How to Play
* Below the game frame there is a text field where you can type a message. Click "Post" to say this message in game.
* You will accrue points as you post. 
* To place an item in the game world, click on the item type you want in the pallet section. This will select an item type. It should appear with a red border around it.
* Once you have selected the item, hit ENTER to place the item.
* Gravity will move items to the ground, or to the top of an item below it. 
* The Avatars in the channel will stand in front of items built. 
* Dolly as well as cats will move around across the area in front of most items.
* However, the darker bricks cannot be moved trough. Use dark brick to keep cats(or Dolly) where you want them.
* Progress does not save between refreshes. The game is short enough to finish in one sitting!
